# ZeroClaw Fork — docker-compose.fork.yml environment variables
#
# With Tailscale Funnel handling inbound webhook traffic, there are no
# docker-compose-level secrets to configure here.
#
# All Slack and Linear secrets belong in config/config.toml (gitignored).
#
# This file is kept for future use and to document the approach:
#   - Webhook tunnel: Tailscale Funnel (run on host, routes → localhost:8080)
#   - Bot secrets:    config/config.toml (bind-mounted into the container)
